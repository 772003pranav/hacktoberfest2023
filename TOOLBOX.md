[Screenshot Machine Screenshot Generator](https://www.screenshotmachine.com/website-screenshot-generator.php)
This tool is helpful for making an og:image for your profile page you create. This will make your page show up nice if you post it to social media. You can use 1200 (width) x 630 (height) as a JPG to make the right size for an og:image. You can upload it to img/yourusername/ and link it in the meta tags of your page.
```
  <meta property="og:image" content="img/yourname/social.jpg">
```
